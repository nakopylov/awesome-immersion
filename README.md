# :books: What?
This is a list of *tools* for language immersion, vocabulary and sentence mining. That is, getting language-learning material from native, organic media such as books, websites, TV series, etc. to be included into your study routine supported by [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) software.

Although many of the tools in this list were created by and for the learners of the Japanese language, the underlying principle is the same for any language.

There is no goal to list the *sources* of media for immersion.
